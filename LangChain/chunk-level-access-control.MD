To restrict user access to specific chunks within a document in a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, you can **implement access
control mechanisms at the chunk level, either by tagging chunks with
permissions or by using role-based access control (RBAC) during the
retrieval process**.

Here's a breakdown of strategies:

**1. Chunk Tagging and Permissions:
\[[<u>3</u>](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/rag-access-control/#:~:text=Role%20based%20access%20control%20(RBAC)%20%2D%20access,it%20can%20still%20be%20complex%20to%20manage.)\]**

- **Tagging:** Assign metadata or tags to each chunk, indicating the
  level of access required to view it.

- **Access Control:** During retrieval, check the user's permissions
  against the tags of the retrieved chunks.

- **Example:** If a chunk contains sensitive financial data, tag it with
  "Financial_Data_Access" and only users with that permission can access
  it.

**2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
\[[<u>3</u>](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/rag-access-control/#:~:text=Role%20based%20access%20control%20(RBAC)%20%2D%20access,it%20can%20still%20be%20complex%20to%20manage.)\]**

- **Roles:** Define user roles with varying levels of access to
  different parts of the document.

- **Chunk Mapping:** Map chunks to the appropriate roles.

- **Retrieval:** During retrieval, filter the results based on the
  user's role and the roles associated with the chunks.

- **Example:** An "Admin" role might have access to all chunks, while a
  "User" role might only have access to specific chunks.

**3. Hybrid Approach:
\[[<u>3</u>](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/rag-access-control/#:~:text=Role%20based%20access%20control%20(RBAC)%20%2D%20access,it%20can%20still%20be%20complex%20to%20manage.)\]**

- Combine chunk tagging with RBAC for more granular control.

- Use RBAC to determine broad access levels and then use chunk tagging
  for finer-grained control.

- **Data Storage:** Choose a data storage solution that supports
  metadata and access control features (e.g., vector databases with
  metadata filtering).

- **Retrieval Pipeline:** Integrate the access control logic into the
  RAG retrieval pipeline to filter out unauthorized chunks.

- **Security:** Ensure that the access control mechanisms are robust and
  secure to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Chunking Strategy:** Consider the impact of your chunking strategy
  on access control. For example, if you use semantic chunking, you
  might need to tag chunks based on their semantic meaning.

- **User Interface:** Design the user interface to clearly indicate the
  level of access a user has to different parts of the document.

**Chunk level Access Control**

In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, restricting access to
specific document chunks for certain users requires an **access control
mechanism**. Here are some approaches to achieve this:

**1. Chunk-Level Access Control**

Instead of returning all retrieved chunks, filter them based on user
permissions before passing them to the LLM.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Tag Chunks with Access Permissions**

    - Store metadata along with document chunks (e.g., access_level,
      user_roles).

    - Example:

> json
>
> CopyEdit
>
> {
>
> "chunk": "This is confidential information.",
>
> "access_level": "confidential",
>
> "allowed_roles": \["admin", "manager"\]
>
> }

2.  **User Role-Based Filtering**

    - When retrieving chunks, check if the user has the required role.

    - If the user is unauthorized, exclude restricted chunks.

3.  **Masked Response Generation**

    - If sensitive content is filtered, replace it with a placeholder
      like \[REDACTED\].

**Tech Stack:**

- **Vector Database:** Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate, ChromaDB (supports
  metadata-based filtering).

- **Authentication:** JWT, OAuth2, IAM for managing user roles.

**2. Query-Time Authorization (Metadata Filtering)**

Some vector databases (e.g., **Weaviate, Pinecone**) allow filtering at
query time.

**Example:**

For **Weaviate**, use a filter to retrieve only authorized chunks:

python

CopyEdit

query = {

"filters": {

"operator": "Equal",

"path": \["allowed_roles"\],

"valueText": "user_role"

}

}

retrieved_chunks = vector_db.query(query)

**3. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

Instead of static role-based filtering, use dynamic attributes like:

- **User attributes** (e.g., department, clearance level)

- **Document sensitivity** (e.g., public, internal, confidential)

- **Contextual factors** (e.g., request time, IP address)

**Example:**  
A university RAG chatbot might restrict **exam answers** to only
teachers:

python

CopyEdit

if user.role == "student" and chunk.category == "exam_answers":

continue \# Skip retrieval

**4. Encryption & Token-Based Access**

For **high-security scenarios**, store sensitive chunks **encrypted**
and decrypt only if the user has the right token.

- Encrypt with AES/GPG.

- Decrypt only if user_id has a valid token.

- Can be combined with **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**.

**5. Policy-Based Enforcement (RBAC & IAM)**

- If deploying on **AWS** (or similar cloud), use IAM policies.

- Define policies like:

  - "Allow managers to access financial data."

  - "Deny students access to staff-only documents."

- AWS **Cognito** or **IAM** can enforce these at the application level.

**6. Redaction using Prompt Engineering**

If some chunks are mistakenly retrieved, you can instruct the LLM to
ignore unauthorized content:

plaintext

CopyEdit

"If the document contains information labeled as 'confidential,' do not
display it."

However, this is less reliable than proper filtering at the retrieval
stage.

**Which Method to Choose?**

| **Use Case** | **Method** |
|----|----|
| Role-based access (e.g., Admin vs User) | Metadata Filtering (RBAC) |
| Attribute-based access (e.g., Department-based) | ABAC |
| High-security (e.g., Legal/Medical docs) | Encryption & Token-Based |
| Cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure) | IAM-based policies |
| Large-scale filtering | Query-time metadata filtering in vector DB |
