      "Meet Jo√£o Moura: Clearbit‚Äôs Senior Engineering ManagerClearbit customer loginBlog>Meet Jo√£o Moura: Clearbit‚Äôs Senior Engineering ManagerMeet Jo√£o Moura: Clearbit‚Äôs Senior Engineering ManagerJess Cody|June 29, 2022|5 minute readFrom teaching a typing class at 13 to managing multiple engineering teams, Jo√£o Moura has always been a leader. And for the past 4 years, he has been building and scaling the Clearbit engineering team as Senior Engineering Manager. Today Jo√£o leads a team of 14 engineers building the Clearbit Data Activation Platform, all while working remotely from Brazil. ¬†We are so excited to share Jo√£o‚Äôs story. If you want to work remotely with awesome people like Jo√£o, check out our open roles!From tech to law school ‚Äî and back to techJo√£o was interested in technology from an early age. He started programming at 13 and enrolled in a web development course. While in the program, a position opened up to teach people how to type faster and more accurately. Jo√£o applied and got the job. At 13 he was commanding a classroom, and as an added benefit, he got to take whatever courses he wanted. This initial position kickstarted a lifelong interest in tech. At 15, Jo√£o started working at an agency, helping them to transition from a traditional old-school print-focused agency to a digital-first company while still attending high school.After high school, he continued on his tech journey working in engineering full-time at Preview Design. He decided to simultaneously pursue law school because, at the time, he felt he ‚Äúalready knew tech‚Äù. Looking back, Jo√£o says, ‚ÄúThat was very naive of me. If you ask me today, I don‚Äôt know tech and I‚Äôm still learning.‚Äù After 4 years of law school, Jo√£o realized he didn‚Äôt have the time or passion to dedicate to law coursework and mandatory court sessions. He was focused on his engineering career and leading talks across the globe in New York, Italy, Atlanta, Israel, and more. In 2014, Jo√£o took the next step in his leadership journey and joined Palpiteros, a soccer social network startup in Brazil, as CTO. He learned a lot from that role, diving into partnerships and staffing. After 2 years Jo√£o left Palpiteros and started working remotely in international markets and ultimately, found his way to Clearbit.Finding the right fit at ClearbitBefore joining Clearbit, Jo√£o ‚Äúwas trying to find something that would be more of a culture match. I wanted to find something that resonated with me.‚Äù That‚Äôs when Jo√£o met Alex McCaw, co-founder of Clearbit. Though the two had exchanged emails back in 2012 when Jo√£o was using one of Alex‚Äôs projects, they didn‚Äôt officially meet until years later. In 2019, Jo√£o reached out to Alex on Twitter to see what was going on at Clearbit. After chatting online about an open role, Jo√£o flew out to San Francisco for a round of in-person interviews. He spent time meeting with team members, getting to know them, and discussing a broad range of topics from engineering to galaxies. After spending time in San Francisco, he knew the role and team were exactly what he was looking for. ‚ÄúThe thing that sold me on Clearbit were those two days in San Francisco,‚Äù Jo√£o says. ‚ÄúEverybody was so friendly.‚ÄùSince joining the Clearbit team, Jo√£o has accumulated a long list of accomplishments. He has won internal hackathons, spearheaded offerings around AI, and worked with customers to test and improve new functionality. One of Jo√£o‚Äôs winning hackathon projects was an automatic audience generator, which paved the way for early experimentation on how we can help our customers learn more about and activate their ideal customer profile.Working remotely from Brazil, he has hired and onboarded engineers across the globe, doubling the size of the team from when he started. Today, Jo√£o has three engineering managers that report to him and he helps them build and grow their respective teams. He has also built strong cross-functional relationships with teams like sales and customer success, helping to drive the business forward.Individual contributor vs. people managerThroughout his career, Jo√£o has learned a lot about what it takes to be a successful leader. He‚Äôs led a classroom of students, managed growing engineering teams, and inspired many in talks across the world. ‚ÄúThere were times where I thought that this is what I was meant for and times I was wondering what I was doing,‚Äù says Jo√£o on his leadership journey. While working with consultancies Jo√£o realized he was good at triaging customer conversations, not just coding. He could navigate technical conversations and make complex topics easy to understand. Having these skills is ‚Äúwhat ended up putting me in the CTO position,‚Äù says Jo√£o. However, his management journey wasn‚Äôt linear. When he first entered international markets, he took a step back from leadership and worked as a senior engineer. This was a challenging time and Jo√£o says, ‚Äúworking with a different culture takes a toll on you. I was very quiet, which is not my personality, and I needed time to get used to a remote environment and working with people of different cultures so I could get back to being comfortable being myself.‚Äù Throughout these experiences, Jo√£o learned the pros and cons of individual contributor and people manager roles and shared some of his advice. ‚ÄúBeing a manager is counterintuitive to being an engineer in many ways. There is an adaptation period you go through‚Äù says Jo√£o. As an individual contributor in engineering, you need blocks of time to figure out a bug or code. In a people manager role, you need to context switch and often have many back-to-back meetings on completely different topics. In addition, results are not always immediate in management roles as they are in individual contributor positions. It may take months or years to see the effects of building and mentoring a successful team. Even so, he still believes that ‚Äúmanagement can be as, if not more, rewarding than being an engineer.‚ÄùLooking to the futureWhile Jo√£o has held many different roles, he says that working at Clearbit ‚Äúis the best job I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù He is extremely proud of the team he has built and the growth of the company. With many more exciting initiatives on the horizon, it‚Äôs only up from here. ‚ÄúWe have a nice foundation and I‚Äôm curious to see where it leads,‚Äù said Jo√£o.

      "Since our founding in 2014, we'd been running as a small, hyper-efficient, and profitable business. Just about everyone in the company would weigh in on new hires, and every new employee spent significant time with the entire leadership team to understand what our values were. This organic model started to show some cracks as we started to scale.\n",
      "At thirty-odd employees, Clearbit did already have a real set of values, even if not everyone could verbalize them. In line with how we were building the company ‚Äî deliberately and with a close eye on creating a culture we all wanted to be a part of ‚Äî it was time to get official. The challenge: to codify and articulate our internal operating principles.\n",
      "We've effectively tripled our team, while maintaining an incredibly high bar and preserving the culture we all cherish. Choosing and then using our values has been instrumental in that success.\n",
      "Surfacing values, from the bottom up\n",
      "We believe that values should be a reflection of the entire team, not just the CEO or leadership. So when we set out to formalize Clearbit's, we started by asking the team.\n",
      "We sent out a survey to every employee, asking them to submit up to three values that they thought best described our culture. Of equal importance, we asked that they nominate the person at Clearbit they thought best exemplified that value.\n",
      "We were expecting to see a wide array of suggestions and had anticipated that the responses would require some serious workshopping to produce a final set. Incredibly, from the over 70 value suggestions, ALL of them could be grouped into 7 themes.\n",

      "We took this list and reworked them to sound as Clearbit-y as possible, which ended up being really easy as we had dozens of variations pre-written by everyone who had submitted ideas. We also combined two of the suggestions, as excellence and learning are inseparable in our minds.\n",
      "Clearbit's Values\n",
      "Care (Give a shit). Empathize with customers. Take the time to understand their frustrations, needs, and desires.\n",
      "Craft (Master it). Own your craft. Never stop learning and improving.\n",
      "Team (Work together). Teamwork makes the dream work. Fill gaps. There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my job.‚Äù\n",
      "Truth (Say it). Be upfront and candid. Say it like it is. Hold yourself and others accountable.\n",
      "Initiative (Be resourceful). Don‚Äôt wait for permission. Figure it out ‚Äî or figure out who can.\n",
      "Fun (Have it). Don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously ‚Äî life is short.\n",
      "So how do we actually use our values?\n",
      "Even the most thoughtfully-produced company values don't matter unless they're put into practice and used tactically. And when they're not actively referenced and applied across the company, they become an out-of-mind list that merely exists as a slide or rarely-opened document.\n",
      "Hiring rubric\n",
      "We built value testing into our hiring rubric and created semi-standardized questions that let us investigate without having to ask questions like, \"are you a team player?\".\n",
      "Person of the week\n",
      "Every week at our all-hands meeting, we highlight one value and a person whose actions best exemplifies that value. This regular practice helps new people get acclimated and gives shape to a list of values they see in their onboarding docs. It also regularly reinforces the values across the company, providing repetition around what they are and a nice moment of recognition and appreciation for team members.\n",
      "Feedback\n",
      "We take feedback seriously here at Clearbit and have worked to weave our values into that process ‚Äî both by celebrating when someone really is leaning into a value and recognizing the learning moments when we fail to (which we all do sometimes).\n",
      "Values are alive!\n",
      "Our list of values is a living document that will evolve and change as we do. A company culture inevitably changes, and our values need to grow with us. If the values don't align or resonate with the individual values of our team, it's time to change.\n",
      "results of an internal survey measuring alignment between personal and company values\n",
      "Having integrity with our values is what builds trust in our relationships, and because we believe trust is the most basic building block of any organization, we commit to checking back on an annual basis to make sure we have values that truly represent our culture.\n",
      "It's easy to discount corporate values as just lip service and nice words to stick on the wall. However, when carefully created and implemented, values provide a constitution for your company culture, a true rubric that helps you hire, fire, promote, retain, and celebrate your team.\n",

The core values should be authentic, reflecting the company's beliefs and priorities, and should be integrated into every aspect of the business.\n",

      "Defining Clearbit's company valuesClearbit customer loginBlog>Defining Clearbit's company valuesDefining Clearbit's company valuesMatt Sornson|August 12, 2019|4 minute readIn mid-2018, Clearbit was hitting an inflection point.\n",
      "Since our founding in 2014, we'd been running as a small, hyper-efficient, and profitable business. Just about everyone in the company would weigh in on new hires, and every new employee spent significant time with the entire leadership team to understand what our values were. This organic model started to show some cracks as we started to scale.\n",
      "At thirty-odd employees, Clearbit did already have a real set of values, even if not everyone could verbalize them. In line with how we were building the company ‚Äî deliberately and with a close eye on creating a culture we all wanted to be a part of ‚Äî it was time to get official. The challenge: to codify and articulate our internal operating principles.\n",
      "We've effectively tripled our team, while maintaining an incredibly high bar and preserving the culture we all cherish. Choosing and then using our values has been instrumental in that success.\n",
      "Surfacing values, from the bottom up\n",
      "We believe that values should be a reflection of the entire team, not just the CEO or leadership. So when we set out to formalize Clearbit's, we started by asking the team.\n",
      "We sent out a survey to every employee, asking them to submit up to three values that they thought best described our culture. Of equal importance, we asked that they nominate the person at Clearbit they thought best exemplified that value.\n",
      "We were expecting to see a wide array of suggestions and had anticipated that the responses would require some serious workshopping to produce a final set. Incredibly, from the over 70 value suggestions, ALL of them could be grouped into 7 themes.\n",
      "being customer centric / empathy for customers\n",
      "learning\n",
      "excellence / hard work\n",
      "self-sufficiency\n",
      "fun\n",
      "honest communication\n",
      "team\n",
      "We took this list and reworked them to sound as Clearbit-y as possible, which ended up being really easy as we had dozens of variations pre-written by everyone who had submitted ideas. We also combined two of the suggestions, as excellence and learning are inseparable in our minds.\n",
      "Clearbit's Values\n",
      "Care (Give a shit). Empathize with customers. Take the time to understand their frustrations, needs, and desires.\n",
      "Craft (Master it). Own your craft. Never stop learning and improving.\n",
      "Team (Work together). Teamwork makes the dream work. Fill gaps. There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my job.‚Äù\n",
      "Truth (Say it). Be upfront and candid. Say it like it is. Hold yourself and others accountable.\n",
      "Initiative (Be resourceful). Don‚Äôt wait for permission. Figure it out ‚Äî or figure out who can.\n",
      "Fun (Have it). Don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously ‚Äî life is short.\n",
      "So how do we actually use our values?\n",
      "Even the most thoughtfully-produced company values don't matter unless they're put into practice and used tactically. And when they're not actively referenced and applied across the company, they become an out-of-mind list that merely exists as a slide or rarely-opened document.\n",
      "Hiring rubric\n",
      "We built value testing into our hiring rubric and created semi-standardized questions that let us investigate without having to ask questions like, \"are you a team player?\".\n",
      "Person of the week\n",
      "Every week at our all-hands meeting, we highlight one value and a person whose actions best exemplifies that value. This regular practice helps new people get acclimated and gives shape to a list of values they see in their onboarding docs. It also regularly reinforces the values across the company, providing repetition around what they are and a nice moment of recognition and appreciation for team members.\n",
      "Feedback\n",
      "We take feedback seriously here at Clearbit and have worked to weave our values into that process ‚Äî both by celebrating when someone really is leaning into a value and recognizing the learning moments when we fail to (which we all do sometimes).\n",
      "Values are alive!\n",
      "Our list of values is a living document that will evolve and change as we do. A company culture inevitably changes, and our values need to grow with us. If the values don't align or resonate with the individual values of our team, it's time to change.\n",
      "results of an internal survey measuring alignment between personal and company values\n",
      "Having integrity with our values is what builds trust in our relationships, and because we believe trust is the most basic building block of any organization, we commit to checking back on an annual basis to make sure we have values that truly represent our culture.\n",
      "It's easy to discount corporate values as just lip service and nice words to stick on the wall. However, when carefully created and implemented, values provide a constitution for your company culture, a true rubric that helps you hire, fire, promote, retain, and celebrate your team.\n",
