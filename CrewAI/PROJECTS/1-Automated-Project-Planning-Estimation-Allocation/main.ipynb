      "\n",
      "3. **Develop User Interface**: Jane Doe, a Software Engineer, is best suited to handle the implementation of the user interface, ensuring adherence to functionality and design specifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Create Navigation System**: Jane Doe takes this task as well, leveraging her UI experience from the previous task to maintain cohesion in user experience design.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Develop \"About Us\" Page**: Collaboratively assigned to Jane Doe and Bob Smith, both will ensure the visual and technical aspects of the page align with the overall website theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Design \"Services\" Page**: Bob Smith is allocated for the service design, allowing for a seamless transition from previous design tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Create \"Contact Us\" Page**: This task goes back to Jane Doe to maintain consistency and make use of the insights gained from earlier UI development tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Implement Blog Section**: Jane Doe pairs up with Bob Smith; the collaborative effort ensures that both the backend setup and frontend design are coherent and functional.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Website Optimization for SEO**: Again, Jane Doe is assigned to ensure integration of technical SEO practices into the existing development framework.\n",
